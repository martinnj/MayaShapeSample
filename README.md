MayaShapeSample
===============

A simple example of how to add user-defined shapes to Maya using plugins.

Note
============
I did not come up with the plugin, it is an interpretation/rewrite
of the apiSimpleShape plugin that ships with Maya 2013. I simply write it
up again manually in order to learn how to introduce shapes in Maya.
